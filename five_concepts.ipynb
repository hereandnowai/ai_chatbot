    "#### âœ… What is it?  \n",
    "`pip` is Pythonâ€™s special **package manager**. Think of it like an **app store** for Python. It lets you easily download and install tools (called **packages** or **libraries**) that others have built, which add new powers to your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Why do we need it?  \n",
    "Python itself is great, but it doesnâ€™t come with everything. For example, to build our chatbot, we need:\n",
    "- A tool to talk to the **Google Gemini API** (`openai` library â€“ yes, thatâ€™s what itâ€™s called for compatibility!)\n",
    "- A way to create a **chat interface** (`gradio`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` helps us get those tools instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… How do we use it?  \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install openai gradio\n",
    "```\n",
